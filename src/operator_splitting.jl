"""
The operator splitting module provides a generic implementation of composition algorithms 
of different order for two operators T and V for solving `` \\frac{dU}{dt} = (T+V) U ``. 
The solution on one time step can be written `` U(Î”t) = \\mathcal{S}_{T+V} U(0) ``. 
The composition algorithm consists in successive solutions of the split equations 
`` \\frac{dU}{dt} = T U `` and `` \\frac{dU}{dt} = V U ``. 
Alternating the two reduced solution operators `` \\mathcal{S}_{T}  ``
and `` \\mathcal{S}_{V} `` with adequately chosen time increments yields arbitrary 
order in time for the full solution.

The application of an operator splitting method to a concrete problem is done
by extending the sll_t_operator_splitting splitting base class by a new type
containing on the one hand the data on which the operators act
and a specific implementation of the two operators
